			<h3>Surgery with AR Tools</h3>

			<p>Virtual reality (VR) is a simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world. Applications of virtual reality can include entertainment (i.e. gaming) and educational purposes (i.e. medical or military training).</p>

			<h3>Ford Manufacturing Plant to Implement VR Training Tools</h3>

			<p>Other, distinct types of VR style technology include augmented reality and mixed reality. Currently standard virtual reality systems use either virtual reality headsets or multi-projected environments to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual environment.</p>

			<h3>New Eye-Tracking Breakthroughs</h3>

			<p>A person using virtual reality equipment is able to look around the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a head-mounted display with a small screen in front of the eyes, but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens.</p>

			<h3>Light-Field Imaging and Depth Mapping</h3>

			<p>Virtual reality typically incorporates auditory and video feedback, but may also allow other types of sensory and force feedback through haptic technology. "Virtual" has had the meaning of "being something in essence or effect, though not actually or in fact" since the mid-1400s.</p>

			<h3>Dragon Fire: A New Virtual Reality Game Reviewed</h3>

			<p>One method by which virtual reality can be realized is simulation-based virtual reality. Driving simulators, for example, give the driver on board the impression of actually driving an actual vehicle by predicting vehicular motion caused by driver input and feeding back corresponding visual, motion and audio cues to the driver.</p>

			<h3>Using Augmented Reality in Elementary Schools for Learning and Fun</h3>

			<p>With avatar image-based virtual reality, people can join the virtual environment in the form of real video as well as an avatar. One can participate in the 3D distributed virtual environment as form of either a conventional avatar or a real video.</p>
